This is a project homework from MBKM DataScience.
The dashboard is in file called dashboardu.py with a file csv called modified.csv.
The dashboard shows the line chart of two variable called RR and RH_avg.
The preview image is shown below.

The code can be installed manually, and must be with the modified.csv to work.
After installing, change the PATH that was already shown inside dashboardu.py and in the terminal.
If the code doesn't work because of the missing module, use pip install (library that shown below)
Possible installation needed:
pip install plotly
pip install dash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
